Pebolim Scoreboard

A lightweight, mobile-optimized foosball goal counter designed for fast and reliable score tracking.

Features:

- Dual-Side Layout: Split-screen interface with the opposing player’s scoreboard rotated 180° for convenient table-top use and mirrored visibility.
- Goal Counter: Large, high-contrast buttons for incrementing each team’s score with a single tap.
- Team-Based Confetti Effect: Animated confetti matching the team colors is triggered automatically whenever a goal is scored.
- Minimalist UI Design: Clean black background featuring blurred SVG football-field lines, combined with a focused red/black/white color palette.
- Digital Scoreboard Typography: All numeric elements use a digital-style font for a scoreboard-like aesthetic.
- Double-Tap Prevention: Cooldown logic prevents accidental multi-increments caused by rapid taps or input noise.
- Responsive Design: Fully functional on desktop browsers but primarily optimized for mobile usability, especially when the device is placed on a foosball table.
